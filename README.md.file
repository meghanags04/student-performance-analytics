Student Performance Analytics – AWS Data Engineering Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS to process,
clean, transform, and analyze student exam performance data using Amazon S3, AWS Glue,
and Amazon Athena.
Architecture
Raw CSV Files (S3) → Glue Crawler → Athena Raw Tables → Athena Views → Final Analytics
View
Datasets
Students (rollno, studentname, email, city)
Subjects (subjectid, subjectname)
Marks (rollno, subjectid, marksobtained, examdate)
Data Issues Identified
• Header rows ingested as data
• Inconsistent schemas (col0, col1, etc.)
• Blank columns after joins
Transformations
• Cleaned data using Athena views
• Joined students, marks, and subjects tables
• Derived PASS/FAIL column based on marks
PASS / FAIL Logic
marks ≥ 40 → PASS, else FAIL
Final Output
student_results_final view containing clean, analytics-ready data
Technologies Used
Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, SQL, Parquet
